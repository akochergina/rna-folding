    "1. removing gap symbols in $x'$ [$y'$] yields the sequences $x$ [$y$], resp.\n",

Extend the function such that it can converts small letters to capital ones and T to U. Write another function to perform this transformation and make the transformation optional in the sequence identity function, e.g. by adding another argument with default ```True```.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function that returns a list of the *edges* in an alignment. An edge is a pair of respective positions $i$ and $j$ in $x$ and $y$ that are in the same alignment column (regardless whether matched or mismatched). The alignment should be givn as a pair of alignment strings. Indexing sequence positions from 1 to the sequence length [*1-based indexing*], edges of our example alignment are (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,6), ..., (12,12). For example, (5,6) is an *edge* of the alignment given by $x',y'$, because the `C` at position 5 of sequence $x$ is in the same column as the `G` at position 6 of $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add meaningful doc strings to your functions. Generally, one should get into the habit of writing at least a brief description for every function / method / class. It is good practice, to describe arguments and return value (see function sequence_identity below). Using type hints, as in sequence_identity (even sporadically), can be a good idea as well.\n",

Typically, we restrict ourselves to structures that can be represented by *dot-bracket strings*. These strings contain only dots ```.``` and opening and closing brackets ```(``` and ```)```. They contain one symbol for each sequence position. The dot marks an unpaired position, while an opening bracket tells that the base is paired to the base of the corresponding closing bracket.\n",

Unlike RNAalifold, your approach should make original use of precomputation of base pair probabilities. This allows a simpler implementation and can speed up the computation. Moreover, it allows us to experiment more easily with variants of the algorithm and write specific extensions to perform fast analysis of RNA families for potential structural heterogeneity. The project will result in efficient novel tools for the structural analysis of RNA family alignments:\n",
