# rna-folding
An RNA prediction approach from alignments of homologous RNAs in the spirit of RNAalifold from the Vienna RNA package. Unlike RNAalifold, our approach will make original use of precomputation of base pair probabilities. This allows a simpler implementation and can speed up the computation.
